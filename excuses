We've still got plenty of IPv4
It's not mature enough
Vendor bugs
IPv6 is a security risk
None of our customers want it
It's too complicated
NAT444 is fine
AWS doesn't support it
IPv6 addresses are too long to remember
Android doesn't support DHCPv6
No one else has deployed it
It's too hard to support
I don't want to expose my MAC address
Too easy for the feds to track
Larger headers are less efficient
Hex is hard
There's no certification track
We don't need that many addresses
We can use RFC6598
Our vendor doesn't support it
