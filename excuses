We've still got plenty of IPv4
It's not <a href='https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2460.txt'>mature</a> enough
Vendor bugs
IPv6 is a <a href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6204#section-4.4'>security risk</a>
None of our customers want it
It's too complicated
NAT444 is <a href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7021#section-3'>fine</a>
AWS doesn't support it
IPv6 addresses are too long to remember
<a href='https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=32621'>Android</a> doesn't support DHCPv6
No one else has <a href='https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html'>deployed</a> it
It's too hard to support
I don't want to <a href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4941'>expose my MAC address</a>
It'll make it <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/LabourUK/comments/3hkblt/im_stella_creasy_ama/cu84dwc'>easier</a> for the government to track me
IPv6 is <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An7s25FSK0U'>slower</a> than IPv4
Larger headers are <a href='http://ipv6.com/articles/general/Top-10-Features-that-make-IPv6-greater-than-IPv4-Part4.htm'>less efficient</a>
Hex is hard
There's no certification track
We don't need that many addresses
We can use <a href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598'>RFC6598</a>
Our vendor doesn't support it
It's not supported by <a href='https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/networking#networks'>Google Compute</a>
There's no ROI on deploying IPv6
<a href='https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/faq/'>Azure</a> doesn't support it
We would have to rewrite our entire application to support it
IPv6 is just a fad
IPv6 isn't supported by <a href='https://www.ovh.co.uk/vps/vps-cloud.xml'>OVH Cloud</a>
Those stupid Privacy Extension addresses <a href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7217#section-3'>keep changing</a>
I can just <a href='http://ipv4marketgroup.com/ipv4-pricing-in-a-post-arin-runout-world/'>buy</a> more IPv4 addresses
Github doesn't support IPv6
Our Lawful Intercept doesn't support IPv6 yet
We'll deploy IPv6 next financial year
